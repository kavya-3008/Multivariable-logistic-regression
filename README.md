# Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis for Dermatology

## Overview
This repository houses the `dermatology.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that applies multivariable logistic regression to dermatological data for predicting skin disease categories. This analysis focuses on understanding the influence of multiple predictors on skin disease diagnosis using statistical modeling techniques.

## Project Structure
- `dermatology.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete logistic regression analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- `images/`: Any graphs or plots generated.
- `docs/`: Further documentation and reference materials.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For dataframe manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing logistic regression and data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For generating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and result presentation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Multivariable Logistic Regression Model**: Building and tuning a logistic regression model that incorporates multiple variables to predict outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize the relationships between variables and the impact on the model's predictions.



## Usage
Open the `dermatology.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis. The notebook includes detailed comments explaining each step of the process, from data preparation to model evaluation.
